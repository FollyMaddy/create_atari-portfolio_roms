# create_atari-portfolio_roms

------------------------------------

This script is without any garantee.

Use it on your own risk.

------------------------------------

Paste your .zip game files into the same directory as the script.

Use the terminal.

Go to that script directory.

Be sure the script is executable.

Run it with 

sudo ./123-pofo-roms.sh

Now it will create .rom files from all .zip files.

Copy these .rom to the ~/RetroPie/roms/pofo directory.

Now you can run the games.

Good luck !
