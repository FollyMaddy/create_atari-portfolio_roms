# create_atari-portfolio_roms

------------------------------------

This script is without any garantee.

Use it on your own risk.

------------------------------------

Paste your .zip game files into the same directory as the script.

Use the terminal.

- Go to the script directory

- Be sure the script is executable with :
 
`chmod u+x 123-pofo-roms.sh`

- Run it with ( It will create .rom files from all .zip files ) :

`sudo ./123-pofo-roms.sh`

  * If 1 executable is found, then this file will be added automatically to the autoexec.bat
  
  * If more executable's are found, then you will be asked to type an executable which is added to the autoexec.bat

- Copy these .rom files to the ~/RetroPie/roms/pofo directory or your specific mame rom directory

- Now you can run the games with mame

Good luck !
